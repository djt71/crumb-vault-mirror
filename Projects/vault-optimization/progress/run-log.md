# vault-optimization — Run Log

## 2026-06-10 — Project creation

**Trigger:** Operator directive following agentic-sunset M1+M2 execution: run an optimization and clean-up pass over the vault, starting by defining the core functionality to be kept and optimized.

**Operator decisions (project creation gate):**
1. Name/domain: `vault-optimization`, domain software, type system, vault-only (no external repo — repo gate skipped)
2. Scope boundary vs agentic-sunset: **agentic-sunset keeps M6/M7** (AS-025–032: _openclaw/_tess/_staging archival, CLAUDE.md diff, skills+memory cleanup). vault-optimization defines core functionality now and acts on everything beyond AS scope. Cleanest provenance.

**Next:** Enter SPECIFY (systems-analyst) — define core functionality to keep/optimize.

## 2026-06-10 — SPECIFY: context inventory

**Context inventory (systems-analyst, standard tier — 4 docs + budget-exempt items):**
1. `_system/docs/adr-crumb-v3-knowledge-store-identity.md` (2026-05-15, **status: proposed — never accepted**) — pre-existing draft of exactly this project's question: v3 identity statement + Tier 1/2/3 keep/dormant/remove categorization + boundary cases + open operator questions. Governing seed artifact.
2. `_system/docs/crumb-v2-system-health-assessment.md` — ceremony-budget provenance; maintenance gravity, shadow workflows, "correct but not used" failure mode
3. `_system/docs/solutions/infrastructure-teardown-discipline.md` — prior art (high confidence): end-conditions, consumer-graph sweeps, creation/removal asymmetry
4. `Projects/agentic-sunset/action-plan-summary.md` — scope boundary (AS keeps M6/M7: AS-025–032)
- Budget-exempt: skill-preflight knowledge brief; signal `systematicls-agentic-engineering-patterns.md` ("less is more", CLAUDE.md-as-directory, periodic consolidation/"spa day")
- Live inventory (Bash): 2,504 md files; 20 skills, 4 agents, 20 scripts, 6 protocols, 8 overlays, 25 solution docs, 12 project dirs, 9 domains; dir weights — Archived 147M, Projects 41M, Sources 12M, _system 5M, _attachments 4.7M
- Overlay index checked: **no overlay loaded** (Crumb-internal infra; Network Skills anti-signals it; no business/financial dimension)
- Signal scan (ceremony/consolidation/simplification keywords): candidates beyond systematicls — `trq212-anthropic-skill-design-lessons`, `code-rams-context-bloat-debugging`, `konik-claude-obsidian-workflow`, `skillsbench-agent-skills-mixed-results` — presented to operator, none read yet

**Key finding:** The "define core functionality" deliverable should build on the proposed v3 ADR rather than start fresh — its acceptance criteria (operator confirms identity, boundary cases, VAL disposition) were never checked off.

## 2026-06-10 — SPECIFY: operator decisions + spec written

**Operator decisions (4-question gate):**
1. v3 identity ADR: **adopt as baseline** — spec refreshes tiers post-sunset, resolves its open questions; acceptance becomes VO-001
2. Scope axes: **all four** — primitive surface, docs & staleness, ceremony reduction, storage & weight
3. Disposition: **aggressive deletion** — git history is the archive (departure from agentic-sunset archive-everything style; history rewrite itself remains a separate default-out decision, A2/U4)
4. Signal inputs: read `trq212-anthropic-skill-design-lessons` + `skillsbench-agent-skills-mixed-results` (both folded into spec evidence base)

**Artifacts written:** `specification.md`, `specification-summary.md` (8 tasks VO-001–008, full four-phase workflow). Cross-project dep **XD-027** added (VO-005/007 blocked on agentic-sunset AS-025–029).

**Spec scope class: MAJOR** (system-wide architecture decision + irreversible deletions) → peer review recommended before PLAN.

## 2026-06-10 — Peer review panel audit + dispatch

**Operator flagged panel staleness before review dispatch — confirmed.** Live /models audit (all 4 providers): `deepseek-reasoner` and `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` removed from their APIs (dispatch would have failed); GPT-5.4 and Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview still current. Operator decisions: DeepSeek slot → `deepseek-v4-pro`; Grok slot → `grok-4.3` **with calibration watch** (Grok-family fabrication record per TV2-Cloud eval of 4.20; first 2–3 reviews get Perplexity-style finding verification). `peer-review-config.md` updated (models, pricing, audit note).

**Dispatching:** peer review of `specification.md` to 4-model panel.

**Review round 1 complete (2026-06-10):** 4/4 reviewers responded first-attempt. Review note + synthesis: `reviews/2026-06-10-specification.md`. Grok calibration watch review 1: 0 fabrications, 1 misread, 1 noise — acceptable, watch continues (tally in peer-review-config.md).

**Synthesis verdict:** spec structurally sound (consumer-graph discipline + manifest controls drew cross-panel STRENGTHs) but **4 must-fix amendments required before PLAN**:
- A1: joint-surface contract with agentic-sunset (ownership matrix; entry gate for VO-005/007) — 4/4 consensus, incl. one CRITICAL
- A2: VO-008 execution model (backup restore-drill verification, batched atomic deletions with consumer remediation per batch, abort/revert + partial-pass rules) — 4/4 consensus, incl. one CRITICAL
- A3: evidence methodology for VO-002 (type-specific standards, 5-category rubric, operator review of all no-evidence deletions) — 4/4 consensus
- A4: end-state deliverables section + VO-009 functional validation task — 3/4
Plus 5 should-fix (A5–A9), 3 defer (A10–A12). Notable contradiction resolved in synthesis: GEM's "assume unused after 15-min search" heuristic declined in favor of OAI's mandatory operator review for no-evidence deletions; timeboxing kept.

**Awaiting operator:** apply must-fix (+should-fix) amendments to spec, then round-2 diff re-review or proceed to PLAN.

**Operator decision:** Claude to assess recommendations on merits; if good, apply and skip re-review (option 2). Assessment: all 4 must-fix + 5 should-fix adopted (A4 notably mirrors our own creation/removal-asymmetry pattern back at us; A8 fixed a genuine internal contradiction — dormant-marking vs aggressive deletion). Amendments applied to `specification.md` + summary refreshed: 9 tasks now (VO-009 functional validation added), evidence methodology + VO-008 execution model + Deliverables/End State sections added, entry gates tightened (Appendix A ownership matrix + AS M6 sign-off before VO-005/007). Deferred to TASK: soak/ceremony metrics (A10–A12 noted in review synthesis).

### Phase Transition: SPECIFY → PLAN
- Date: 2026-06-10
- SPECIFY phase outputs: `specification.md` (peer-reviewed, amended), `specification-summary.md`, `reviews/2026-06-10-specification.md` (+4 raw JSONs), XD-027 in cross-project-deps, peer-review-config.md roster refresh
- Goal progress: all SPECIFY acceptance criteria met — problem statement, facts/assumptions/unknowns separated, system map with levers, domain + workflow depth classified, 9 tasks with risk levels + ACs + dependencies, summary written, MAJOR-scope peer review completed with amendments applied
- Compound: one candidate flagged for operator approval (not auto-written, per Ask First): **external-model roster rot** — third documented instance of review-panel config drifting against provider APIs (GPT-5.2→5.4 upgrade 2026-03-14; Gemini forced migration 2026-03-14 after 5-day-old deprecation; DeepSeek+Grok models removed from APIs, caught 2026-06-10 only because operator prompted a check). Proposed pattern: verify roster against live `/models` endpoints before high-stakes dispatch or on a staleness clock; candidate for `_system/docs/solutions/`. Secondary observation (no action): Grok 4.3 calibration watch opened — review 1: 0 fabrications, 1 misread, 1 noise
- Context usage before checkpoint: high (long session: SPECIFY + panel audit + review cycle) — PLAN should start from a fresh session via vault reconstruction
- Action taken: commit + recommend fresh session for PLAN
- Key artifacts for PLAN phase: `specification-summary.md` (primary), `reviews/2026-06-10-specification.md` synthesis section (A10–A12 deferred items), `_system/docs/adr-crumb-v3-knowledge-store-identity.md` (VO-001 target)

## 2026-06-10 — Session end

Session-end protocol run: report written to session_reports.db (`20260610T190927f103764`); inbox `.processed/` empty; qmd index updated (20 hashes pending `qmd embed` — non-blocking); no failure-log entry (session clean); no code-review sweep (no repo_path).

**Cost observation (model routing):** systems-analyst + peer-review synthesis kept on session model (reasoning tier) — appropriate, both were judgment-heavy. Mechanical dispatch delegated to peer-review-dispatch subagent (~55k subagent tokens, 12 tool uses, clean single-pass). External review cost ≈$0.30 (4 reviewers, new pricing). No Sonnet delegation this session — no execution-tier skills invoked.

**Protocol zombie flag (for AS-025/029 or VO-007):** session-end step 2 writes session reports to `~/.tess/state/session_reports.db` — its consumer (Tess) is decommissioned, so this is now an orphaned producer per infrastructure-teardown-discipline #2. Wrote the report this session for protocol compliance; the step should be retired or re-pointed when the session-end protocol is next revised.

## 2026-06-10 — PLAN: context inventory

Fresh session, vault-based state reconstruction (project-state.yaml + run-log).

**Context inventory (PLAN, standard tier — 4 docs):**
1. `specification-summary.md` — entry point
2. `specification.md` (full) — design must cover all 9 tasks' methodology, evidence rubric, VO-008 execution model
3. `_system/docs/adr-crumb-v3-knowledge-store-identity.md` — Tier 1/2/3 model, boundary cases, open questions (VO-001 target)
4. `reviews/2026-06-10-specification.md` — synthesis excerpts only: deferred items A10 (soak/ceremony metrics → TASK), A11 (Archived/-as-category cleanup → VO-006), A12 (vault-only wording → Appendix A)
- Overlay check: none loaded (unchanged from SPECIFY assessment — Crumb-internal infra)
- Conventions check (design-spec v2-4, grep-scoped): PLAN produces design docs in `design/`; gate is risk-tiered

**PLAN deliverable:** `design/optimization-design.md` + summary — evidence/manifest schema, consumer-graph protocol, ownership matrix structure, batch execution design, soak design, AS sequencing.

## 2026-06-10 — PLAN: design written

**Artifacts:** `design/optimization-design.md` + `design/optimization-design-summary.md`.

**Design decisions (D1–D6):**
- D1: manifest schema (item/rubric/evidence/disposition/owner/operator-review), type-specific evidence commands, Appendix A ownership-matrix schema with per-surface gates. Manifest scope = primitives + `_system/` docs + project records; KB content excluded (operator to confirm). Orphaned `session_reports.db` readable as supplementary evidence — not kept alive for it.
- D2: nine-surface consumer-graph protocol with recorded commands → `design/consumer-graph-survey.md` at VO-003.
- D3: storage policy structure on the three-outcome distinction; Archived/ exception-extraction before deletion; dead-log producer-alive check; history rewrite default-out (U4 decision recorded either way).
- D4: batch design — B0 backup restore-drill gate, B1 Archived → B2 attachments/logs → B3 docs → B4 scripts/protocols/overlays → B5 skills/agents → B6 ceremony. Primitives last so VO-009 description re-tests run against the final surface. Grounded against live plist inventory (10 active, incl. operator-kept dashboard stack per A3).
- D5: ceremony steps classified load-bearing / zombie / mergeable; trigger-condition descriptions on all kept skills; gotchas only where a failure is on record.
- D6: six representative Tier-1 soak workflows; metrics deferred to TASK per A10.

**Gap found:** end-state deliverable #2 (core-functionality operating note) has no producing task in the spec's decomposition — proposed VO-002 draft / VO-009 finalize split; fix at TASK refinement.

**PLAN gate (risk-tiered):** design contains high-risk decisions (VO-008 batch model, Archived/ deletion order, backup authority) → operator approval required before TASK. Open decisions: (1) KB-content exclusion from manifest scope, (2) authoritative restore source for B0 drill, (3) batch order, (4) operating-note split.

## 2026-06-10 — PLAN gate: operator decisions

All four gate decisions resolved (operator, 4-question gate — all recommended options accepted):
1. Manifest scope: **KB content excluded** (Sources/, Domains/ are Tier-1 data, not surface; weight via VO-004 only)
2. B0 authoritative restore source: **git remote** (matches "git history is the archive"); Drive/mirror = secondary freshness checks
3. Batch order: **as designed** — B1 Archived/ → B2 attachments/logs → B3 docs → B4 scripts/protocols/overlays → B5 skills/agents → B6 ceremony
4. Operating note: **split** — VO-002 draft, VO-009 finalize; action-architect encodes at TASK

Design doc + summary updated to record decisions inline. PLAN gate passed.

### Phase Transition: PLAN → TASK
- Date: 2026-06-10
- PLAN phase outputs: `design/optimization-design.md` (D1–D6), `design/optimization-design-summary.md`, 4 gate decisions recorded
- Goal progress: PLAN deliverable met — design covers all 9 tasks' execution mechanics (evidence schema, consumer-graph protocol, ownership-matrix schema, batch model, soak shape); high-risk decisions operator-approved; A10 metrics and the operating-note task fix explicitly routed to TASK
- Compound: one candidate flagged for operator approval (not auto-written, per Ask First): **deliverables-contract cross-check** — spec's end-state deliverable #2 had no producing task; proposed routing is a one-line check in action-architect's procedure ("every end-state deliverable maps to a producing task"), not a new solutions doc. Single observed instance → medium confidence
- Context usage before checkpoint: low (fresh session; 4 docs + design writes — well under 50%)
- Action taken: none (proceed in-session)
- Key artifacts for TASK phase: `specification-summary.md`, `design/optimization-design-summary.md` (both in context), spec Task Decomposition table + acceptance criteria

## 2026-06-10 — TASK: action-architect

**Context inventory (action-architect, standard tier):** spec + spec-summary, design + design-summary already in session context (written/read this session — no re-load). New loads: `_system/docs/estimation-calibration.md` (tail), XD-027 row, baseline regeneration via Bash (budget-exempt mechanical), skill-preflight knowledge brief (ambient — DNS/visualization, not relevant, discarded). Signal scan (step 1b): keyword sweep over Sources/signals+insights surfaced no new how-to-build signals beyond those folded into the spec at SPECIFY (systematicls, trq212, skillsbench) — no operator re-prompt (ceremony budget). Overlay check: no match (unchanged).

**Inventory baseline regenerated (per D1):** 2,511 md files (+7 since spec snapshot); other counts unchanged (20 skills / 4 agents / 8 overlays / 20 scripts / 6 protocols / 25 solutions / 12 projects / 10 plists; Archived/ 147M). Snapshot recorded in action-plan.md header.

**Artifacts:** `action-plan.md` (5 milestones M1–M5), `tasks.md` (27 atomic tasks VO-010–036), `action-plan-summary.md`.

**Decomposition decisions:**
- 9 spec lines → 27 atomic (3.0x) — agentic-sunset teardown calibration (2.6x, "2–3 atomic per scrap-N-things line") applied predictively; calibration row added to estimation-calibration.md.
- Spec tension resolved: VO-005/006/007 become *changeset-definition* tasks (M3, no mutations); all deletions/edits execute under M4 batch discipline (B0 backup gate first); spec ACs for those groups verified at batch checkpoints B3–B6.
- A10 closed (no longer deferred): ceremony metrics defined at VO-025 — per-ceremony mandatory-step counts before/after, zombie count → 0, named consumer/enforcer per kept step, checklist diff proves no gate semantics lost. Soak end-condition defined at VO-034: 14 calendar days AND ≥8 sessions from B6 commit, whichever later.
- Operating-note split encoded: VO-018 draft / VO-036 finalize (PLAN gate decision).
- XD-027 row updated: gates now task-precise (VO-031/032 ← Appendix A frozen + AS M6 sign-off; VO-026/033 ← AS-025). VO-031/032 created in `blocked` state.
- Bulk-deletion footprint rule: ≤5 *edited* files per batch commit; deleted files enumerated in run-log, not counted against task footprint.

**Peer review offer (step 6): HIGH impact** — irreversible structural deletions + multi-skill modification → recommend peer review of action-plan.md before IMPLEMENT. Awaiting operator: 'peer review' or 'proceed'.

## 2026-06-10 — TASK: operator decisions + peer review dispatch

**Operator decisions:** (1) peer review of action-plan.md approved — dispatching; (2) compound candidate approved — deliverables-contract cross-check added as one line to action-architect Output Quality Checklist (`.claude/skills/action-architect/SKILL.md`). Compound insight executed (routed: primitive update, not solutions doc).

## 2026-06-10 — Action plan peer review: round 1 + amendments

**Dispatch:** 4/4 reviewers first-attempt (GPT-5.4 62.5s, Gemini 3.1 Pro 55.3s, DeepSeek V4 Pro 110.2s, Grok 4.3 12.8s; ≈$0.10 estimated). Safety gate: 2 soft entropy flags, both false positives (topic tag, path phrase). Review note + synthesis: `reviews/2026-06-10-action-plan.md` (+4 raw JSONs).

**Grok calibration watch review 2:** 9 findings — 0 fabrications, 1 misread (GRK-F3), 1 noise (GRK-F4); tally in peer-review-config.md. One more review to close the watch.

**Synthesis verdict:** no CRITICALs; structure + changeset/execution split + A10 closure drew 4/4 STRENGTHs. **2 must-fix + 9 should-fix, all applied same day** (assess-on-merits precedent from spec round):
- A1 (must): cross-batch integrity — batch-open changeset-staleness check; forward-fix-from-git rule; halt-M4 + restore + re-enter-M3 fallback (OAI-F13, GEM-F2, DS-F4 consensus)
- A2 (must): drift control — inventory re-diff at M3 close + every batch open; new items dispositioned pre-batch; evidence-status changes return to operator (OAI-F26/F30)
- A3–A11 (should): soak failure protocol + working-session/"needed" definitions + max() end-condition; per-batch named changeset packs + spec-AC→checkpoint traceability map; VO-026 frozen pending-AS-025-release + VO-033 AS-025 verification AC; sub-batch rule + VO-029 3-way split by risk profile; functional fast-pass at batch commits; citation pass (baseline→run-log, calibration→estimation-calibration.md, gates→cross-project-deps.md, vault-check→script); definitional tightening; A12 disposition stated; tasks.md cross-reference + embed-both-artifacts rule for future plan reviews.
- Declined (recorded with categories in synthesis): OAI-F8, DS-F2, OAI-F12, OAI-F16 (incorrect premise — per-task ACs/edges live in tasks.md, which reviewers didn't receive), GRK-F3 (misread), GRK-F4 (noise), GEM-F2 sequential-drafting option (overkill vs refresh-at-execution).

**Meta-lesson (captured as A11, no new solutions doc):** reviewing action-plan.md without tasks.md generated 4 incorrect-premise findings — plan reviews must embed the AC source artifact.

Amendments applied to action-plan.md + tasks.md; action-plan-summary.md refreshed. Re-review skipped (amendments follow panel consensus; same operator precedent as spec round).

## 2026-06-10 — Pre-VO-010: ADR-vs-goals analysis

Operator requested analysis of the v3 ADR against project goals before IMPLEMENT entry. Delivered in-conversation; conclusion: **minor drift → proceed**, with a four-point refresh agenda for VO-010:
1. Tier 3 re-stated as executed/AS-owned (sunset M1/M2 already tore most of it down; remainder is AS M6/M7 per XD-027)
2. Tier 2 narrowed to a canonical-reference/compound-provenance exception list — "keep dormant" predates the aggressive-deletion decision and contradicts it (spec amendment A8 killed dormant-marking)
3. Mission Control disposition ("shed") must be reconciled with the later operator decision to keep the dashboard stack (spec assumption A3) — the one live boundary-case decision
4. Tier 1 skill enumeration (17/20 skills) demoted to presumptive-keep — tiers govern categories; the VO-002 manifest owns item-level dispositions (SkillsBench evidence)
Open questions status: Q1 answered by events (pollers gone, intake stays open); Q2 = point 3 above; Q3 recommend outside-Crumb read-only runtime; Q4 settled by AS-029 ownership + model-behavior memories demonstrably earning keep. Also: liberation-directive refs in CLAUDE.md are NOT Tess-specific — survive the rewrite. **Operator endorsed the analysis ("great, pls proceed").**

### Phase Transition: TASK → IMPLEMENT
- Date: 2026-06-10
- TASK phase outputs: `action-plan.md` (M1–M5, peer-reviewed round 1, 11 amendments applied), `tasks.md` (27 atomic tasks VO-010–036), `action-plan-summary.md`, `reviews/2026-06-10-action-plan.md` (+4 raw JSONs), XD-027 task-precise update, estimation-calibration row, action-architect deliverables cross-check (compound, operator-approved)
- Goal progress: all TASK acceptance criteria met — decomposition complete with binary ACs and dependency edges, risk levels assigned, calibration consistent (3.0x vs 2.6x precedent), HIGH-impact peer review completed with must-fix amendments applied
- Compound: TASK-phase insight already routed — embed-the-AC-source-artifact rule for plan reviews captured as amendment A11 in the plan + review note (first instance; no solutions doc). Prior pending candidate (external-model roster rot) remains awaiting operator decision — not re-raised this phase
- Context usage before checkpoint: moderate (~50-60% — long session: PLAN + TASK + review cycle). Proceed band; VO-010 is a light ADR-edit task. If IMPLEMENT continues past VO-010, prefer fresh session for M2 evidence passes
- Action taken: none (proceed in-session for VO-010 only)
- Key artifacts for IMPLEMENT phase: `tasks.md` (AC source), `_system/docs/adr-crumb-v3-knowledge-store-identity.md` (VO-010 target, in context), refresh agenda above

## 2026-06-10 — VO-010 complete: v3 ADR accepted

**Decision gate outcome: PROCEED** (minor drift — identity statement and tier model unchanged; snapshot content refreshed). **Operator sign-off: 2026-06-10** — analysis endorsed in-conversation ("great, pls proceed") + explicit MC boundary-case decision via question gate.

**ADR edits** (`_system/docs/adr-crumb-v3-knowledge-store-identity.md`):
- Frontmatter `status: proposed → accepted`, updated 2026-06-10, related_projects += agentic-sunset, vault-optimization
- New **Acceptance Refresh (2026-06-10)** section (prevails over 2026-05-15 snapshot where they differ; original retained as provenance): (1) Tier 3 executed/AS-owned, (2) Tier 2 narrowed to canonical-reference/compound-provenance (aggressive-deletion supersedes "keep dormant"), (3) **MC: runtime shed, stripped dashboard kept** (operator decision — dashboard/vault-web/cloudflared survive as knowledge-work viewing surface; panels face VO-002 rubric), (4) Tier 1 skill enumeration demoted to presumptive — manifest owns item dispositions
- All 4 open questions answered in the ADR (pollers-by-events / MC above / reactivation = outside-Crumb read-only runtime, no in-vault automation without new ADR / Tess memories = AS-029 ownership, model-behavior memories confirmed keeps)
- All 5 acceptance boxes checked (external-review box satisfied indirectly — ADR-as-baseline panel-reviewed twice today; noted inline)
- Inline annotations at Tier 2, Tier 3, and MC boundary case pointing to the refresh section

**VAL disposition handoff:** VAL-001/002/003 closed as superseded by this acceptance; the `tess-harness-plan-tracking.yaml` file update rides with AS-030 (tess-v2 closures are AS-owned) — flagged here for the AS run-log.

**VO-010 ACs:** all four pass (status accepted ✓, 5 boxes ✓, open questions answered ✓, gate outcome + sign-off this entry ✓). tasks.md updated to done. **Next: VO-011+ (M2 evidence passes) in a fresh session** — context moderate-high after PLAN+TASK+review+VO-010.

## 2026-06-10 — Session end

Single session carried PLAN (design D1–D6 + 4 operator gate decisions) → TASK (action-plan + 27 tasks + panel review + 11 amendments + compound fix to action-architect) → IMPLEMENT M1 (VO-010: ADR accepted, MC boundary decision). Two phase-transition checkpoints ran in-session; context bands held (never exceeded proceed band before VO-010, which was deliberately light).

**Compound evaluation:** primary insight already routed mid-session (A11 embed-the-AC-source rule → action plan + review note + memory). Secondary observation, no doc: the **dated Acceptance Refresh pattern** for accepting a stale ADR — refresh section prevails over the original snapshot, original retained as provenance, inline annotations pointing forward — worked cleanly; if it recurs (second stale-ADR acceptance), capture as a solutions entry. Pending compound candidate from SPECIFY session (external-model roster rot) still awaits operator decision.

**Cost observation (model routing):** all reasoning-tier work (PLAN design, action-architect, review synthesis, ADR analysis/acceptance) on session model — appropriate, judgment-heavy throughout. Mechanical dispatch delegated to peer-review-dispatch subagent (~60k subagent tokens, 16 tool uses, clean single-pass). External review ≈$0.10 (4 reviewers; Grok 12.8s/$0.01-class). No execution-tier skills invoked → no Sonnet delegation. No routing adjustments indicated.

**Session-end protocol notes:** session report written to session_reports.db (zombie-producer flag from previous session stands — retire/re-point at VO-025/B6); no failure-log entry (clean session); code-review sweep + build verification skipped (no repo_path).

## 2026-06-10 — M2: VO-011–015 complete (manifest + all four evidence passes)

**Session start (fresh, vault-based state reconstruction):** project-state + run-log tail + tasks.md + action-plan-summary + design doc (D1 schema). Context inventory: 5 project docs loaded; no overlays (unchanged — Crumb-internal infra); skill-preflight not fired (no skill invocations — direct task execution under IMPLEMENT).

**VO-011 — manifest skeleton.** Baseline regenerated per D1: 2,515 md files (+4 vs TASK regen; counts drift only in md total — all structured counts identical: 20/4/8/20/6/25/12 projects/10 plists; Archived/ 147M). `keep-set-manifest.md` created: 199 item rows across 13 sections, every row typed + owner placeholder from Appendix A draft; scope-boundary note (KB content + logs + harness memory excluded); Appendix A schema embedded with status=draft (freeze at VO-016). Doc clusters defined per-subdir, with explosion rule recorded (split-disposition cluster → per-file rows).

**VO-012 — skills + agents.** Commands: log greps (session-log*.md, all run-log*.md), `git log --grep` per name, session_reports.db (16 sessions 2026-04-06→06-10, supplementary per D1), structural refs (CLAUDE.md, settings hooks, skill-preflight-map). Key evidence finds: (1) prior consolidation round on record (session-log.md:148,157) — obsidian-cli→vault-query, excalidraw→mermaid already merged; **deferred-merge list** critic→peer-review, learning-plan→systems-analyst, writing-coach→peer-review, checkpoint→audit — adopted as prop: dispositions; (2) attention-manager proven-active via today's daily note frontmatter (skill_origin); (3) feed-pipeline + vault-query flagged sunset-tied → AS-028 coordination; (4) CLAUDE.md still cites "obsidian-cli skill" — stale ref → B6 fix list. 24/24 rows categorized, zero unknown.

**VO-013 — scripts + plists.** Commands: per-script grep over LaunchAgents plists + settings*.json + sibling scripts; `git log -1` per file; `launchctl list` (all 10 loaded; cloudflared PID 684, vault-web PID 689). Dashboard stack (cloudflared/dashboard/vault-web) marked **operator-kept (A3)** ✓. Superseded: bridge-watcher.py(+parked plist), openclaw-isolation-test.sh, tess-health-check.sh, vault-search.sh (tess-v2 Phase 4a artifact; 2026-06-09 touches were tess-danny-migration mechanical path-rewrites, not usage). No-evidence: batch-moc-placement.py, clear-claude-cache.sh, dns-recon.sh (operator work utility — decision flagged). qmd-index + vault-rebuild = viewing-stack adjacency, A3-extension question recorded for VO-016/017.

**VO-014 — overlays + protocols.** Hyphenated grep under-matches — re-swept with prose names ("Life Coach" etc.). All 8 overlays evidenced (activation logs and/or named in kept-skill procedures: attention-manager/learning-plan/mermaid/deck-intel) — index presence not counted per D1 ✓. Protocols: session-end + inline-attachment structural (CLAUDE.md); bridge-dispatch, dispatch-triage, research-brief-review **superseded** (referenced only by decommissioned dispatch surfaces) ✓; hallucination-detection contingency (CLAUDE.md cites spec §4.8, not the file — merge question to VO-024).

**VO-015 — docs/solutions/projects.** Bulk sweep: per-file basename refs + last-commit across 25 solutions, 62 root docs, 15 skill-workflows, 8 doc clusters, 6 _system clusters, 12 projects. Headline finds: (1) **skill-workflows/ layer is a zero-consumer orphan** — nothing references it (CLAUDE.md, skills, operator docs, orientation-map, dashboard all swept); 12 no-evidence + 3 superseded; (2) openclaw-*/tess-crumb-* doc families superseded (AS concurrence; openclaw-crumb-reference flagged as possible AS-029 input first); (3) executed specs (compound-enhancements, peer-review-skill-spec, change-spec-model-routing) → prop: delete, provenance in git; (4) _system/schemas split: a2a/briefs/capabilities superseded, deliberation/assessment-schema structural (cluster exploded per rule); (5) solutions corpus healthy — 21/25 keep with refs, 1 superseded (lucidchart), 3 to VO-024; (6) file-conventions refs=89 and goal-tracker refs=81 = top structural anchors. Project records: all keep (provenance; archival is operator-initiated); feed-intel-framework archival + tess-danny-migration status question flagged for operator/AS. Zero unknown rows manifest-wide ✓.

**No-evidence delete candidates queued for VO-017 operator review (19 rows):** batch-moc-placement.py, clear-claude-cache.sh, dns-recon.sh, adr-cli-native-agent-architecture, code-setup-prerequisites, proposal-pattern-enforcement-schema, vault-intake-overview-diagram (.md + .excalidraw), vault-startup-detection-diagram, + 12 skill-workflows layer files (superseded rows need no per-item sign-off per D1 rule, but sunset-tied ones carry AS-concurrence flags into VO-023/024 packs).

**M2 remaining:** VO-016 (Appendix A freeze — time with AS session boundary), VO-017 (operator sign-offs), VO-018 (post-017), VO-019/020 (post-017), VO-021/022 (unblocked — next mechanical work).

## 2026-06-10 — VO-017 complete: operator sign-off on no-evidence deletes

**Operator decision (in-conversation, 2026-06-10): "approve all"** — wholesale sign-off on all 21 no-evidence delete rows (3 scripts incl. dns-recon work-utility call, 6 root-doc rows incl. the diagram .md/.excalidraw pair, 12 skill-workflows layer files). Manifest operator-review cells updated to `approved+signed 2026-06-10 (operator, wholesale)`; dns-recon disposition resolved to prop: delete.

**feed-intel-framework:** operator said "keep feed-intel-framework in archive for now" — recorded as: record stays in place (phase DONE, Projects/), no deletion, **formal archival deferred**. Interpretation note: not moved to Archived/ — that would put it inside B1 deletion scope; if operator intended a formal archival, it should wait until after B1 executes (flagged here for visibility).

**VO-017 AC:** zero no-evidence delete rows without operator sign-off ✓ (21/21 signed).

**Unblocked:** VO-018 (operating note draft), VO-019/020 (consumer-graph surveys over all delete rows). VO-021/022 remain unblocked. VO-016 still waits on AS session boundary. Recommend fresh session for VO-019–022 (grep-heavy surveys + Archived/ enumeration; current session context high after manifest build).

## 2026-06-10 — Session end (M2 evidence session)

Fresh session carried M2 from VO-011 through VO-017: keep-set manifest built (199 rows, 13 sections), all four evidence passes completed with recorded commands, zero unknown rows, and operator wholesale sign-off on all 21 no-evidence delete rows (+ FIF archival deferred, dns-recon delete approved). Two commits pushed (aa74ae72 manifest, 5808df55 sign-off). M2 remainder: VO-018–022 (fresh session), VO-016 (AS session-boundary timing).

**Compound evaluation:** no new solutions doc. (1) skill-workflows orphan layer is a clean confirming instance of the existing Ceremony Budget Principle (capability added without consumer wiring → zero adoption) — evidence recorded in manifest + run-log, principle already constitutional. (2) Methodological note already recorded in VO-014 entry: prose-name grep over hyphenated-slug grep for activation evidence (slug grep under-matches by ~6x on overlays). (3) Cluster-row-with-explosion-rule worked on first use (schemas cluster split a2a/deliberation) — pattern stays manifest-local unless it recurs elsewhere.

**Cost observation (model routing):** all judgment work (rubric assignment, supersession calls, evidence synthesis) on session model — appropriate throughout. All evidence gathering via direct Bash greps (mechanical, budget-exempt) — no skill invocations, no subagent dispatch, no external review spend. No routing adjustments indicated.

**Session-report step:** attempted per protocol §2 (tess CLI) — see note below this entry for outcome; zombie-producer flag on session_reports.db write stands (retire/re-point decision lives at VO-025/B6 ceremony classification).

*Session-report outcome: written successfully (tess CLI alive — session_id 20260610T214515f609183, row 18, sequence 3 for 2026-06-10). qmd update ran; inbox .processed empty; failure-log not warranted (clean session); code-review sweep + build verification skipped (no repo_path).*
